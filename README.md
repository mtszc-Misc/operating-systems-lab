Repo contains bash scripts with solutions for lab instructions. Also there is Python project, which measure differences between "First Come First Served" algorithm and "Shortest Job First" algorithm.

## General info
Bash scripts cover basic commands for navigation in Linux file system. Also there are more advanced subjects, such as:
* creating links
* permissions
* working with files
* advanced searching
* regex
* arithmetic
* arrays

In Python project in one cycle program generate 0, 1 or 2 processes with random duration with normal distribution, variance equal to 5 and central point of distribution equal to 10, 20, 30 depending on test. Program generate 3-elements lists, which contain basic process data: entering time, duration time and waiting time. With that input program compares which algorithm is faster for different data sets.

## Technologies
* Python 3
* GIT
* Linux/Bash

## Status
Project is: _Done_
